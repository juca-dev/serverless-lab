# Serverless Lab

From code to cloud, faster.

## Objective

This repository is a **collaborative project** built together with the community and followers.  
Our goal is to create a complete **serverless application** step by step, using **TypeScript**, **AWS CDK**, and **CI/CD with GitHub**.

## How it works

- The project is divided into **steps**, each documented under [`docs/step/`](docs/step/).
- Every step introduces new concepts and code, so you can **follow along** and evolve the project with us.
- Code examples live inside the repository, while explanations are provided in the docs.

## Steps

- [Step 01 – Serverless Setup](docs/step/01/README.md)
- [Step 02 – Serverless Foundations](docs/step/02/README.md)
- Step 03 – (coming soon)
